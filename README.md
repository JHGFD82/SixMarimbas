# Visualizer Tools

These tools are developed to assist in the process of turning music data into video projects. This includes the individual tasks of importing CSV files converted from MIDI using [MIDICSV](https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/), cleaning and parsing the data, addressing potential visual quirks for keyboard-based instruments, assigning values based on spatial differences between notes, and exporting the data for use in other applications.

## Installation

To be made available on PIP someday.

## Usage

To be written by me someday.

## Features

Detail overall main.py function as well as utility in individual modules.

## Contributing

Are you forking me right now? Totally not ready for that yet.

## License

I own nothing made with these tools, but require proper crediting. Besides, this is for the betterment of society which is now relying on video over books for their edutainment.

## Contact/Support

Coming soon.

## Acknowledgements

No person is an island. Paul Simon was wrong, he is not a rock, he is a person. Garfunkel, however, the jury's still out.

## Addendum

Seriously, I just converted this from only being a small series of steps for my own use to a potential Python package that I coudl be proud of if I put in the work. Cut me some slack if I don't write documentation like it'll apply to every written language just yet.
